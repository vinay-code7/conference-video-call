# Conference Video Call App

Welcome to the Conference Video Call App! This is a simple web application built using Express, Socket.IO, Peerjs, and EJS that allows users to create and join video conference calls.

## How to Use
- Visit the site at [videocall-express.onrender.com](https://videocall-express.onrender.com/)
- Simply enter a room ID that you want to create a new room.
- Tell your friends this room ID and they can join the same room.

## Features
- Create a new conference room using any room id you want.
- Join an existing conference room using the room ID.
- Real-time video and audio communication between participants in the same room.
- Secure and reliable communication.
- Simple and intuitive user interface for easy usage.

## Technologies Used
- Express: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- Socket.IO: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between the browser and the server.
- Peerjs: A library for WebRTC peer-to-peer communication.
- EJS: A simple and effective templating language to generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript.

## Demo
Yes, I literally gathered 4 devices to make the demo and the one with blurry video is actually my broken webcam. ðŸ˜†. PS. Message me if you ever want to have conversation with me on this app. ðŸ˜ƒ
